# JavaScript Practice

For this week's practice, we will be looking into javascript variables, data types and operators. 

## Step 1: 

Create a java script file, and log Hello world to console. 

## Step 2: 

Create 3 different variables. one for your name, one for your age and one for your favourite color. these should be variable that you can change later on. 

Create a variable that can not be changed, set this to your date of birth. 

With a peace of paper draw a map of the RAM and how memory is allocated for your variables and its data types.

## Step 3: 
Print a statment like this to console. "Aria is 24 years old, he is born on Sep 15, 2022 and his favourite color is black"

## Step 4: 
create anothe set of name, age, favourite color and date of birth variables for a firnd. 

through JS logic, if your friend is older than you, print out "John is older than Aria"

through JS logic, add 1 to your age and print the same statment from step 3. 

through JS logic, add your age to your frined age, calculate the sum and print out a statemnt like this: "Sum of aria and john's age is 30"

# step 5: 
play around with data types, add to them, convert them and do comparison and print the results. if you are curious about how JS handles a certain scenario, then try it. do this untill everyhting makes sense to you and you are comfortable with all the operators
