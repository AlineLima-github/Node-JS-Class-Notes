# Class 3 - Practise 

This week, we are again going to try and create a 404 page. these pages are displayed when you go to a page in a website but the that page doesnt exists. 

This one includes the same basic elements, but styling is more advancaded. 

I also want you to publish this on Github.

Im sure you have noticed CSS can get confusing with styling and worrying about how things look. Good news is, there are libraries of css code that people have written. for this practise, and this course, we want to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). in simple terms, bootstrap is css code that others have written. we can either download it and include in our repo to link to it, or link to it via CDN. this means they ahve made their css file avilable through the web so you can link to it easily. After you have the css all you need to do is use their class name to apply styling to your elements. look at the docs and see how you can do different things. 

Try to make this page yours, the image is just a sample. 

For those of you looking for more advanced topics, try to add a home page. this can be any HTML page you want. clicking on the button should take users to the home page. 

If you are doing the advance section, make your home page your index page. then try to configure your 404 page so when user goes to any other paths they are shown the 404 page.
