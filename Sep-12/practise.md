# Class 3 - Practise 

This week, we are again going to try and create a 404 page. these pages are displayed when you go to a page in a website but the that page doesnt exists. 

This one includes the same basic elements, but styling is more advancaded. 

I also want you to publish this on Github

For those of you looking for more advanced topics, try to add a home page. this can be any HTML page you want. clicking on the button should take users to the home page. 

If you are doing the advance section, make your home page your index page. then try to configure your 404 page so when user goes to any other paths they are shown the 404 page.
